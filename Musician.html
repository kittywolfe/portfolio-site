    <h2 class="cover-heading"> Musician </h2>
    <p class="lead"><br> <strong> Joshua has been playing music since he was a child. At age 7, he started
    playing piano, and this paved the way for him to grow up in a world of music. He dropped piano
    at age 8, but he never ditched the idea of music. When he was 10, he became interested in guitar,
    but he didn't start playing it until age 12. At 13, Josh met two friends with whom he would later
    form a band with, a guitarist named Andrew, and a drummer named Solomon. Andrew convinced Josh to
    play bass instead of guitar, because then they could eventually start a 3 person band. So, he started
    learning bass, and fell in love, almost completely abandoning the guitar. </strong> </p>

    <h2> The Band </h2>
    <p class="lead"> <br> <strong> About a year later, Andrew and Josh formed a classic rock, folk, and 
    jazz band, then called The Sonic Warning, and about a year later, Solomon joined as a drummer. 
    For the next 5 years, Joshua continued playing the bass, and loved playing rock, metal, funk, and
    jazz on the bass. The band fell apart after releasing one album, when Josh moved to Orlando,
    Florida for a year in 2016, and upon his return to Boise, rebranded as a heavy metal band, 
    Pain Included, although their drummer had joined the Navy by this point, so to this date, they 
    have not recorded an album. At the end of 2019, as Joshua's creative tastes began to widen thanks
    to his University program, he began to take up other musical interests. </strong></p>

    <h2> Other Interests </h2>
    <p class="lead"> <br> <strong> In mid 2019, Joshua played a game called God of War. This game was
    very inspirational for him for a variety of different reasons. One of the big reasons was the music.
    In Joshua's opinion, God of War has the best soundtrack in any video game or movie to this date.
    He became interested in the man who scored God of War, Bear McCreary. Mr. McCreary inspired Josh
    to start looking into composing music, and the first thing that it made him want to do was learn
    more instruments, so that he was capable of producing a wide range of different sounds. The first
    instrument that Josh learned was the Ocarina. He chose this because of it's simplistic design, the 
    ease of playing it, and because it's in another favorite video game series of his, The Legend of
    Zelda. He started playing it in November of 2019, and then picked up another instrument at the end
    of December, the Harp. The harp exposed him to classical music, Irish folk music, and harp covers of
    popular songs, which all sound very beautiful on the harp. In January 2020, he started taking harp 
    lessons, and he has loved the harp ever since, which is now his primary instrument.

    </strong>
    </p>
    
    <h2> Influences </h2>
    <p class="lead"> <br> <strong> Joshua's main influences on bass since 2014 have been 
      Geezer Butler, Larry Graham, Jack Bruce, and Cliff Burton. They are all very talented bassists
      from varrying genres of music, and all four have influenced how Josh plays bass. Now, Joshua takes
      a lot of inspiration from Hans Zimmer, Bear McCreary, John Williams, Dmitri Shostakovich and 
      Pyotr Tchaikovsky in his desire to compose music, and learn various instruments. In his style and 
      taste, Joshua is very inspired by the Celtic, Scottish, and Welsh folk traditions, and has been
      overtaken with the desire to be more experimental and broad with the kind of music that he plays
      and writes.
